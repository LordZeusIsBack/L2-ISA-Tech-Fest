## Overview

This repository hosts the code behind **Level 2 of the Tech Fest** organized by the **IntellexAI Student Association (ISA)**. It represents an amalgamation of innovative ideas, AI integration, and technical challenges aimed at pushing the boundaries of creative and technological problem solving. This project is written in Python and leverages modular design principles, ensuring clarity and ease of collaboration.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Modules:** Contains an AI model component to drive intelligent features.
- **Modular Configuration:** Easy-to-edit configuration files to adapt the project to various environments.
- **Dynamic Web Pages:** A dedicated `pages` directory that can be extended for interactive web-based components.
- **Clean Code Structure:** Organized directories (`ai_model`, `config`, `pages`) for better maintainability.
- **MIT Licensed:** Free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the MIT license.

### Directory Details

- **`ai_model/`**:  
  Houses the core AI components. This may include training scripts, model architectures, and utility functions necessary for processing and predictions.

- **`config/`**:  
  Contains configuration files to fine-tune settings such as environment variables, model parameters, and runtime options.

- **`pages/`**:  
  Hosts the web-based interfaces or static pages that can be integrated with the backend. Modify or add new pages as the project evolves.

- **`main.py`**:  
  The primary entry point that ties together various modules. Running this file initiates the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** is required.
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for managing dependencies.
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended) such as `venv` or `virtualenv`.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LordZeusIsBack/L2-ISA-Tech-Fest.git
   cd L2-ISA-Tech-Fest
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, ensure that you review and update the configuration settings to match your environment.

- **Configuration Files:**  
  The `config/` directory includes files that control how the application runs. Update these files to set parameters like API keys, model configurations, or other environment-specific variables.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  If your project depends on specific environment variables, set them in your shell or in a `.env` file as per your deployment needs.

## Usage

To launch the project, execute the main entry script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will start the application, initialize the AI model, load configurations, and render the necessary pages. Logs and outputs will appear in the console, and further instructions might be printed depending on the runtime behavior.

## AI Model Integration

The `ai_model/` directory contains scripts and modules that handle the AI logic:
  
- **Model Loading:** The code initializes and loads pre-trained models.
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing scripts to handle input data for the AI model.
- **Prediction & Inference:** Functions that use the AI model to generate results and insights.

Make sure that any updates to the AI component are reflected in both the model scripts and in the integration points in `main.py`.
